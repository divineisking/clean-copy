Software systems rarely fail in one dramatic moment they erode quietly over time. A small assumption slips in harmless at first and then another follows. Eventually the system reaches a point where behavior diverges from intent not because of one bad decision, but because of many reasonable ones stacked together. In user-facing tools especially browser extensions text handling becomes a subtle battlefield. Copying content from a document editor introduces invisible characters zero-width spaces, smart punctuation, non-breaking glyphs that survive unnoticed until they collide with strict parsing logic. Em dashes are a perfect example typographically correct, visually elegant, and operationally treacherous. An engineer might assume a dash is a dash until it isn't. The hyphen-minus (-), the en dash (–), and the em dash ( ) are different code points, treated differently by browsers, editors, and clipboard APIs. When pasted into a rich input like a contenteditable field the browser may normalize them, preserve them, or duplicate them depending on timing, event phase, and DOM mutation order. This is why clipboard-related bugs feel irrational they aren't random, but they are emergent. The system behaves correctly in isolation engine works, adapter works, tests pass yet fails when all pieces interact in real time. That gap between correctness and reality is where most production bugs live. Fixing issues like this isn't about adding more regex it's about understanding where ownership of the text changes hands. The moment the clipboard hands control to the browser before the DOM, before frameworks, before observers that's where truth is decided. And once that's understood everything else becomes mechanical.
